Sadly the GeauxRobot Raspberry Pi Dog and Bone case is currently out of stock and as my partner and I have a new Christmas tradition of building a Star Wars Lego model I decided to build an enclosure with Lego so I could keep the switch, power and Pis neatly together. After a special trip to the local Fenwick store to pick up a large box of classic Lego bricks and base plate I set about constructing an enclosure.

It took a couple of attempts to get something 'just right' and the enclosure sadly lacks a certain playful inventiveness that I had when I first start playing with Lego but it's sufficient for my needs at present and keeps the Pis firmly upright so that the status lights are viewable from the front and the network cables are accessible from the back. 

The colours represent each host (with a spare slot) so left to right: dark blue is blueberry-pi, gooseberry-pi, custard-pi, peach-pi, and strawberry-pi, with red being master-baker the master node.

From the back the network cables are accessible and ethernet port lights viewable. I hope to get shorter cables 25cm cables soon which will put less strain on the Lego.

Sadly even with no 'roof' the Pis run a little on the warm side so I suspect eventually I will have to build a proper enclosure but it's been fun to play with Lego again.
