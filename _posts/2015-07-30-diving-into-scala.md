After getting excited by Apple's new language Swift I thought I'd delve into the Swift 1.2/iOS world and functional programming by working through "[Functional Programming in Scala](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Functional-Programming-Scala-Paul-Chiusano/dp/1617290653)" by Paul Chiusano, RÃºnar Bjarnason, followed by [Programming iOS 8](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Programming-iOS-Views-Controllers-Frameworks/dp/1491908734). Translating the Scala listings and exercises from the 'red book' to Swift was pretty straight-forward and gave me an appreciation of the similiarities between the two languages, which you can see in my [func_book_exercises repo](https://github.com/leannenorthrop/func_book_exercises).

Sadly though towards the end of Chapter Six on action transitions and state I became unstuck by an apparent Swift compiler issue not being able to distinguish typing correctly for calls to `map2`. I was becoming aware that although the language is exciting it's still changing, rapidly, and perhaps at the moment not the best language to cut my teeth on regarding functional programming techniques. It made sense taht since I have a strong background in Java to be less hasty with new these new toys and to take a simpler route by learning Scala first by working through "[Programming Scala](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Programming-Scala-Scalability-Functional-Objects/dp/1491949856)" by Dean Wampler and Alex Payne and then revisiting Chiusano and Bjarnason. The Scala eco-system is mature and exciting with such projects as Scala-JS, Play, Spark etc. So although I'd dearly have liked to have published a couple of iPad applications by the end of the year I think the Scala world has a lot to offer. 

Entering a mature area such as Scala is not without it's issues though. As a 'newbie' encountering "well-known" yet undocumented issues with tools such as activator has proven to be a pain. So I thought I document my Scala learning over the coming weeks by keeping notes in this blog.
