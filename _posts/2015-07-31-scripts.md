Since I require a light-weight learning environment I like to use Sublime Text 3 with an SBT console session running side-by-side. Because SBT will attempt to compile script files with the `.scala` extension I prefer the `.sc` extension described in "Programming Scala". I mention in [Sublime Scala]({{ site.base-url }}{% post_url 2015-07-30-sublime-scala %}) how to set up Sublime to work with these files. However these files can be compiled if passing an `-Xscript somename` to the compiler which causes the somename to become the main entry point into the resultant application.
