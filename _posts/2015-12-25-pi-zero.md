When MagPi magazine shipped in November with the new Raspberry Pi model Zero I was thrilled at the prospect of creating a mini cluster of three nodes. At a retail price of Â£5 each it was an exciting prospect of scaling up and I was dreaming big. My partner and I spent an entire Saturday visiting the various listed stockists in Newcastle but come 5 o' clock with no luck I resigned myself to not being able to see one let alone own one until mass produced.

Amazingly, having forgotten all about the zero/cluster as a project for another year, I recieved a Pi Zero for Christmas! It's so small and I never thought I see the day I'd see an entire computer on a board smaller than a credit card. So exicted! I hardly know what to tinker with or try first. As only one can be purchased at a time I also received 6 Raspberry Pi 2's! So the thrill of setting up my own cluster to tinker with and learn all the latest techniques were revived!. Hurrah for Christmas and the kindness of my loved ones. Roll on the New Year when I can play in earnest.
