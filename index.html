    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p><span class="text-danger">Please Note</span> I recently updated this site to use Google's new <a href="https://www.ampproject.org">AMP</a> framework however due to time constraints I had to pare back the CSS quite radically but rather too quickly for comfort. I hope this site is viewable across browsers and OS and humbly apologise for the inconvience if not and ask you pay a quick visit to <a href="https://github.com/leannenorthrop/leannenorthrop.github.io/issues">raise a new issue</a>. Many Thanks</p>
    <p>I'm a software developer by profession and I've been exposed to a range of technologies and languages throughout my career. Currently on a short career break I'm using my free time to delve into new languages and areas such as Scala, Node, and Swift/iOS, and other topics like Crypotography and CSS. This is a small site for hosting my blog on these new language explorations and programming in general.</p>
