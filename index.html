            <p>I'm a software developer by profession and I've been exposed to a range of technologies and languages throughout my career. Currently
            on a short career break I'm using my free time to delve into new languages and areas such as Scala and Swift/iOS.
            This is a small site for hosting my blog on these new language explorations and programming in general.</p>
